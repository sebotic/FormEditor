FormEditor
==========

A Java Swing based form editor, allowing for creation and layouting of simple forms. It also generates the MySQL table layout for the form, so when a designed form is populated with data, data can be saved directly to the corresponding MySQL table.

The primary design principle is to allow users who are normally only able to use Powerpoint and Excel, easy access to designing useful forms with a powerful RDBMS as a backend.
